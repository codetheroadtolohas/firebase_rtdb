          <h2>Pyrolysis</h2>
          <p>
            The pyrolysis (or devolatilization) process is the thermal
            decomposition of materials at elevated temperatures, often in an
            inert atmosphere.[1] It involves a change of chemical composition.
            The word is coined from the Greek-derived elements pyro "fire",
            "heat", "fever" and lysis "separating"
          </p>
          <p>
            Pyrolysis is most commonly used in the treatment of organic
            materials. It is one of the processes involved in charring wood.[2]
            In general, pyrolysis of organic substances produces volatile
            products and leaves char, a carbon-rich solid residue. Extreme
            pyrolysis, which leaves mostly carbon as the residue, is called
            carbonization. Pyrolysis is considered the first step in the
            processes of gasification or combustion.[3][4]
          </p>
          <p>
            The process is used heavily in the chemical industry, for example,
            to produce ethylene, many forms of carbon, and other chemicals from
            petroleum, coal, and even wood, or to produce coke from coal. It is
            used also in the conversion of natural gas (primarily methane) into
            hydrogen gas and solid carbon char, recently introduced on an
            industrial scale.[5] Aspirational applications of pyrolysis would
            convert biomass into syngas and biochar, waste plastics back into
            usable oil, or waste into safely disposable substances.

          <h3>Terminology</h3>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Pyrolysis is one of the various types of chemical degradation
            processes that occur at higher temperatures (above the boiling point
            of water or other solvents). It differs from other processes like
            combustion and hydrolysis in that it usually does not involve the
            addition of other reagents such as oxygen (O2, in combustion) or
            water (in hydrolysis).[6] Pyrolysis produces solids (char),
            condensable liquids (tar), and uncondensing/permanent
            gasses.[7][8][9][10]

          <h3>General process and mechanisms</h3>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Pyrolysis generally consists in heating the material above its
            decomposition temperature, breaking chemical bonds in its molecules.
            The fragments usually become smaller molecules, but may combine to
            produce residues with larger molecular mass, even amorphous covalent
            solids.[citation needed]
          </p>
          <p>
            In many settings, some amounts of oxygen, water, or other substances
            may be present, so that combustion, hydrolysis, or other chemical
            processes may occur besides pyrolysis proper. Sometimes those
            chemicals are added intentionally, as in the burning of firewood, in
            the traditional manufacture of charcoal, and in the steam cracking
            of crude oil.[citation needed]
          </p>
          <p>
            Conversely, the starting material may be heated in a vacuum or in an
            inert atmosphere to avoid chemical side reactions (such as
            combustion or hydrolysis). Pyrolysis in a vacuum also lowers the
            boiling point of the byproducts, improving their recovery.
          </p>
          <p>
            When organic matter is heated at increasing temperatures in open
            containers, the following processes generally occur, in successive
            or overlapping stages:[citation needed]
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Below about 100 °C, volatiles, including some water, evaporate.
              Heat-sensitive substances, such as vitamin C and proteins, may
              partially change or decompose already at this stage.
            </li>
            <li>
              At about 100 °C or slightly higher, any remaining water that is
              merely absorbed in the material is driven off. This process
              consumes a lot of energy, so the temperature may stop rising until
              all water has evaporated. Water trapped in crystal structure of
              hydrates may come off at somewhat higher temperatures.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some solid substances, like fats, waxes, and sugars, may melt and
              separate.
            </li>
            <li>
              Between 100 and 500 °C, many common organic molecules break down.
              Most sugars start decomposing at 160–180 °C. Cellulose, a major
              component of wood, paper, and cotton fabrics, decomposes at about
              350 °C.[3] Lignin, another major wood component, starts
              decomposing at about 350 °C, but continues releasing volatile
              products up to 500 °C.[3] The decomposition products usually
              include water, carbon monoxide CO and/or carbon dioxide CO2, as
              well as a large number of organic compounds.[4][12] Gases and
              volatile products leave the sample, and some of them may condense
              again as smoke. Generally, this process also absorbs energy. Some
              volatiles may ignite and burn, creating a visible flame. The
              non-volatile residues typically become richer in carbon and form
              large disordered molecules, with colors ranging between brown and
              black. At this point the matter is said to have been "charred" or
              "carbonized".
            </li>
            <li>
              At 200–300 °C, if oxygen has not been excluded, the carbonaceous
              residue may start to burn, in a highly exothermic reaction, often
              with no or little visible flame. Once carbon combustion starts,
              the temperature rises spontaneously, turning the residue into a
              glowing ember and releasing carbon dioxide and/or monoxide. At
              this stage, some of the nitrogen still remaining in the residue
              may be oxidized into nitrogen oxides like NO2 and N2O3. Sulfur and
              other elements like chlorine and arsenic may be oxidized and
              volatilized at this stage.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once combustion of the carbonaceous residue is complete, a powdery
              or solid mineral residue (ash) is often left behind, consisting of
              inorganic oxidized materials of high melting point. Some of the
              ash may have left during combustion, entrained by the gases as fly
              ash or particulate emissions. Metals present in the original
              matter usually remain in the ash as oxides or carbonates, such as
              potash. Phosphorus, from materials such as bone, phospholipids,
              and nucleic acids, usually remains as phosphates.

          <h3>Occurrence and uses</h3>
          <hr />
          <h2>Cooking</h2>
          <p>
            Pyrolysis has many applications in food preparation.[13]
            Caramelization is the pyrolysis of sugars in food (often after the
            sugars have been produced by the breakdown of polysaccharides). The
            food goes brown and changes flavor. The distinctive flavors are used
            in many dishes; for instance, caramelized onion is used in French
            onion soup.[14][15] The temperatures needed for caramelization lie
            above the boiling point of water.[14] Frying oil can easily rise
            above the boiling point. Putting a lid on the frying pan keeps the
            water in, and some of it re-condenses, keeping the temperature too
            cool to brown for longer time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pyrolysis of food can also be undesirable, as in the charring of
            burnt food (at temperatures too low for the oxidative combustion of
            carbon to produce flames and burn the food to ash).
          </p>
          <h2>Coke, carbon, charcoals, and chars</h2>
          <p>
            Carbon and carbon-rich materials have desirable properties but are
            nonvolatile, even at high temperatures. Consequently, pyrolysis is
            used to produce many kinds of carbon; these can be used for fuel, as
            reagents in steelmaking (coke), and as structural materials.
          </p>
          <p>
            Charcoal is a less smoky fuel than pyrolyzed wood.[16] Some cities
            ban, or used to ban, wood fires; when residents only use charcoal
            (and similarly-treated rock coal, called coke) air pollution is
            significantly reduced. In cities where people do not generally cook
            or heat with fires, this is not needed. In the mid-20th century,
            "smokeless" legislation in Europe required cleaner-burning
            techniques, such as coke fuel[17] and smoke-burning incinerators[18]
            as an effective measure to reduce air pollution[17]
          </p>
          <p>
            The coke-making or "coking" process consists of heating the material
            in "coking ovens" to very high temperatures (up to 900 °C or 1,700
            °F) so that the molecules are broken down into lighter volatile
            substances, which leave the vessel, and a porous but hard residue
            that is mostly carbon and inorganic ash. The amount of volatiles
            varies with the source material, but is typically 25–30% of it by
            weight. High temperature pyrolysis is used on an industrial scale to
            convert coal into coke. This is useful in metallurgy, where the
            higher temperatures are necessary for many processes, such as
            steelmaking. Volatile by-products of this process are also often
            useful, including benzene and pyridine.[19] Coke can also be
            produced from the solid residue left from petroleum refining.
          </p>
          <p>
            The original vascular structure of the wood and the pores created by
            escaping gases combine to produce a light and porous material. By
            starting with a dense wood-like material, such as nutshells or peach
            stones, one obtains a form of charcoal with particularly fine pores
            (and hence a much larger pore surface area), called activated
            carbon, which is used as an adsorbent for a wide range of chemical
            substances.
          </p>
          <p>
            Biochar s the residue of incomplete organic pyrolysis, e.g., from
            cooking fires. It is a key component of the terra preta soils
            associated with ancient indigenous communities of the Amazon
            basin.[20] Terra preta is much sought by local farmers for its
            superior fertility and capacity to promote and retain an enhanced
            suite of beneficial microbiota, compared to the typical red soil of
            the region. Efforts are underway to recreate these soils through
            biochar, the solid residue of pyrolysis of various materials, mostly
            organic waste.
          </p>
          <p>
            Carbon fibers are filaments of carbon that can be used to make very
            strong yarns and textiles. Carbon fiber items are often produced by
            spinning and weaving the desired item from fibers of a suitable
            polymer, and then pyrolyzing the material at a high temperature
            (from 1,500–3,000 °C or 2,730–5,430 °F). The first carbon fibers
            were made from rayon, but polyacrylonitrile has become the most
            common starting material. For their first workable electric lamps,
            Joseph Wilson Swan and Thomas Edison used carbon filaments made by
            pyrolysis of cotton yarns and bamboo splinters, respectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pyrolysis is the reaction used to coat a preformed substrate with a
            layer of pyrolytic carbon. This is typically done in a fluidized bed
            reactor heated to 1,000–2,000 °C or 1,830–3,630 °F. Pyrolytic carbon
            coatings are used in many applications, including artificial heart
            valves.[21]
          </p>
          <h2>Liquid and gaseous biofuels</h2>
          <p>
            Pyrolysis is the basis of several methods for producing fuel from
            biomass, i.e. lignocellulosic biomass.[22] Crops studied as biomass
            feedstock for pyrolysis include native North American prairie
            grasses such as switchgrass and bred versions of other grasses such
            as Miscantheus giganteus. Other sources of organic matter as
            feedstock for pyrolysis include greenwaste, sawdust, waste wood,
            leaves, vegetables, nut shells, straw, cotton trash, rice hulls, and
            orange peels.[3] Animal waste including poultry litter, dairy
            manure, and potentially other manures are also under evaluation.
            Some industrial byproducts are also suitable feedstock including
            paper sludge, distillers grain,[23] and sewage sludge.[24]
